Some of these patterns have been tried and proven effective in individual environments, but others are idea-based and have not yet been tested for effectiveness in actual team environments.
Please feel free to leave comments on GitHub Issues. We look forward to various discussions and the sharing of knowledge about AI Powered development.

## What are Patterns and Exercises

Patterns are a way of describing repeatable solutions to problems within a specific context.
In AI Native development, patterns provide ideas for how developers and teams can use AI to achieve rapid product development.

- **Patterns**: These are tried and true solutions to common problems and scenarios you might encounter when developing with GitHub Copilot.
- **Exercises**: Practical hands-on tasks that can help reinforce your understanding and application of the patterns.
