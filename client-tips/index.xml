Description # GitHub Copilot, which utilizes OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s Large Language Models (LLM) to generate code, has a limitation on the number of tokens it can process. As of 2023, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t see all of the code that&amp;rsquo;s open in the editor and doesn&amp;rsquo;t receive every token.</description></item><item><title>GitHub Copilot Shortcuts</title><link>/client-tips/github-copilot-shortcuts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/client-tips/github-copilot-shortcuts/</guid><description>GitHub Copilot Shortcuts # Description # GitHub Copilot provides developers with a set of keyboard shortcuts to accelerate the coding process. These shortcuts make the navigation and interaction with GitHub Copilot&amp;rsquo;s AI-driven suggestions more intuitive and efficient. In this pattern, we will explore the keyboard shortcuts that are essential for rapid code development with Copilot.
Example # For example, to accept a suggestion from Copilot, you can simply press the TAB key.</description></item><item><title>Go to definition</title><link>/client-tips/go-to-definition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/client-tips/go-to-definition/</guid><description>Go to definition # {% hint style=&amp;ldquo;info&amp;rdquo; %} GitHub Copilot will not read all codebases as of August 2023, so there will be occasions when this technique will be necessary. On the other hand, there is a possibility that in the near future this technique will no longer be needed in GitHub Copilot, and this technique may be very limited. {% endhint %}
Description # When working with a complex codebase, jumping between files or searching through layers of code to find the definition of a particular symbol can be cumbersome.</description></item><item><title>Pin the files you need</title><link>/client-tips/pin-the-file-you-need/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/client-tips/pin-the-file-you-need/</guid><description>Pin the files you need # Description # The effectiveness of GitHub Copilot depends on the context provided to it. GitHub Copilot searches through open tabs by text similarity, sending snippets to the Large Language Model (LLM), which itself is a complete black box. Therefore, we must be mindful of the context we want to provide. In programming, files such as declaration files (d.ts), test files, and interface files contain a wealth of context information.</description></item></channel></rss>
