In the AI era, files such as Infrastructure as Code, database table specifications, test requirements, and more have the potential to be instantly transformed into actual code. Rather than dealing with complex Excel, PowerPoint files, PDFs, or image formats, AI will be able to assist your coding efforts collaboratively through text-based documents.</description></item><item><title>Coaching on Prompts and Code Generating Process</title><link>/collaboration/coaching-on-prompts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/collaboration/coaching-on-prompts/</guid><description>Coaching on Prompts and Code Generating Process {% hint style=&amp;ldquo;info&amp;rdquo; %} While this sounds reasonable, it is not a systematic or established pattern. {% endhint %}
Description Using an AI tool like GitHub Copilot can make the output look cleaner than it should. Code that looks perfect when you review it may actually be inefficient in the generation process or missing something important. Coaching on the generative process becomes essential to ensure that developers are aware of potential pitfalls and can create efficient and accurate code.</description></item></channel></rss>
