# Code Completion

The easiest way to use GitHub Copilot is for code completion. 
Code completion improves developer productivity by providing candidate code as the developer types.

For example, suppose you are defining a function in JavaScript. You might enter the following code:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    // Enter the processing here
}
```

At this point, GitHub Copilot will offer candidate code that might be used inside the function. For example, it might provide the following code:

```js
const sum = a + b;
return sum;
```

If the developer selects this candidate code, the following code will be inserted inside the function:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    const sum = a + b;
    return sum;
}
```

## GitHub Copilot Reference Priority

GitHub Copilot refers to several recently opened files of the same language and calculates similarities to determine which files to include in the prompt. 
The current logic is not public, but there are notes on reverse engineering, so please take a look.

## Note

GitHub Copilot provides code generated by AI, so the automatically generated code may not be entirely accurate. Developers must review the generated code and manually make corrections as necessary.
By using GitHub Copilot's code completion feature, developers will need to manually enter code less often.
