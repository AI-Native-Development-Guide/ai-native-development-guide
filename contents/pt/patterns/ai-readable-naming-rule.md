## Description

This document explains patterns of naming conventions that can be useful when writing code. By using these patterns, you can write code that is more readable, understandable, and maintainable.

## Problem

When writing code, you may struggle with how to name variables and functions. Also, if you try to provide context only through comments, the code may become difficult for the reader to understand. This difficulty in readability can also affect the accuracy of suggestions made by GitHub Copilot. Eventually, you may not receive accurate suggestions from GitHub Copilot.

## Context

GitHub Copilot uses an engine called Codex, which utilizes a GPT-3 based model. The GPT-3 based model can understand natural language, so by using variable expressions similar to natural language, you can write code that is more readable and understandable.

## Solution

If you are struggling with naming variables and functions when writing code, you can create a common naming convention with your team in advance, based on GitHub Copilot. By using variable expressions similar to natural language, rather than providing context only through comments, GitHub Copilot can make more accurate suggestions.

Here are some examples of naming convention patterns:

* Use lowercase
