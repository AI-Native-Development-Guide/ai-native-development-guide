## Language Translation

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Lv2-Practically_Viable_Pattern-green">](https://github.com/orgs/AI-Native-Development/projects/1/)

### Description

Sometimes, developers may need to translate code from one language to another, such as from Python to JavaScript or HTML to Markdown. This is where GitHub Copilot shines as a virtual aide. Imagine a scenario where a team is working on a multi-platform project, and they need to quickly convert a Python algorithm into JavaScript for web integration. GitHub Copilot's Language Translation ability can save hours of manual translation, enabling seamless cross-language development.

#### Example

Here's an example of translating a Python function into JavaScript:

Python code:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Using GitHub Copilot, we can effortlessly translate it into JavaScript:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Exercise

- **Exercise 1**: Translate a simple HTML structure into Markdown using GitHub Copilot.
- **Exercise 2**: Convert a given Python class into its equivalent Java representation.
- **Exercise 3**: Write a C# function and then translate it into Ruby using GitHub Copilot.
