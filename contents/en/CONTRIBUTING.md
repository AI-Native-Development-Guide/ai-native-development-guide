# Contributing to GitHub Copilot Patterns & Exercises

The goal of the GitHub Copilot Patterns & Exercises Working Group is to collect, document, and publish best practices for GitHub Copilot Patterns & Exercises. To ensure they are easy to understand, evaluate, and apply, we present them in a specific structure.

  We recommend starting by exploring the existing patterns and materials in this repository. Did you spot a confusing phrase or incorrect grammar? Is there a content error? Create a GitHub Issue or suggest a correction directly via a pull request.
* **Verify the use of patterns**:
  Confirming that multiple organizations have adopted a pattern increases its significance and reassures potential adopters that the pattern is reliable. If you're implementing any of the published patterns, list your organization as a known example of that pattern and describe your experience in applying it.
* **Translate existing patterns**:
  When introducing GitHub Copilot Patterns & Exercises in your area, a language barrier might deter individuals since most GitHub Copilot Patterns & Exercises content is in English.

* **Contribute to new patterns**:
  A significant contribution is documenting the best practices of GitHub Copilot Patterns & Exercises that you're familiar with or have experienced.

First-time contributors should target Maturity Level 1: Initial (unstructured experience reports or patterns with incomplete sections) and 2: Structured (best practices adhering to the pattern format and basic textual representation rules).
