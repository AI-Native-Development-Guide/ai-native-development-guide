## Asking with Open-Ended Questions

Utilizing open-ended questions to ask about code improvement, such as how to improve the restorability of code, how to improve error handling, and how to access UI components.k

### Description

Refactoring code can often be a complex and nuanced process. It's not always about what's wrong or right, but rather understanding the underlying concepts and potential improvements. By utilizing open-ended questions in GitHub Copilot, developers can approach code improvement in a more thoughtful way. This pattern focuses on how to ask questions related to restorability of code, error handling, and accessing UI components, enabling the AI to assist in enhancing the code's efficiency and robustness.

#### Samples

Introducing open-ended questions in your queries with GitHub Copilot can lead to insightful suggestions. For example:

```javascript
// Q: How can I improve the restorability of this function?
// A: <GITHUB COPILOT SUGGESTION>
function backupData(data) {
  // Implementation here
}

// Q: What's the best way to handle errors in this context?
// A: <GITHUB COPILOT SUGGESTION>
try {
  // Some operation
} catch (error) {
  // Error handling
}
```

### Exercise

- **Exercise 1**: Write a function related to file handling and ask Copilot how to make it more reliable and efficient.
- **Exercise 2**: Create a code snippet that includes exception handling and ask Copilot for suggestions to improve error reporting.
- **Exercise 3**: Design a simple UI component and ask Copilot how to access or manipulate it in a more elegant way.
