## Making the Calculation Part Independent

LLM is not good at calculating for now. Moving the calculation part to a separate function makes it easier to develop and maintain.

### Description

In the rapidly evolving world of software development, relying on tools like GitHub Copilot can enhance the development process. However, when it comes to performing complex calculations, the current implementation of Language Learning Models (LLMs) may have limitations. To address this, developers can refactor their code by moving the calculation part to a separate function. This enhances code maintainability, readability, and makes it easier to test and develop further. Imagine a scenario where a developer is building a financial software system, and the calculation of interest rates needs to be isolated from the user interface logic. By decoupling this complex calculation, they create a flexible and more resilient codebase.

#### Samples

**Calculating and Handling Order Totals**

Before, when the calculation logic was mixed with other functionalities:

```python
def handle_order(order_items):
    tax_rate = 0.05
    total = 0
    for item in order_items:
        total += item['price']
    total += total * tax_rate
    process_payment(total)
    ship_order(order_items)
    return total
```

After, when the calculation logic is completely separated from other functionalities:

```python
def calculate_total(order_items, tax_rate=0.05):
    subtotal = sum(item['price'] for item in order_items)
    total = subtotal + (subtotal * tax_rate)
    return total

def handle_order(order_items):
    total = calculate_total(order_items)
    process_payment(total)
    ship_order(order_items)
    return total
```

Here, the `calculate_total` function takes care of all the calculations related to the order total, while the `handle_order` function handles other related functionalities, such as processing payment and shipping the order.

### Exerecise

- **Exercise 1**: Identify a portion of code in your project where the calculation logic is mixed with other functionalities and refactor it using the pattern described above.
- **Exercise 2**: Write tests for both the calculation part and the non-calculation part to ensure that they function as intended independently.
- **Exercise 3**: Assess the impact of this refactoring on the code's maintainability, readability, and reusability.

### Checklist for Further Learning

- How can I identify other areas in my codebase where the calculation logic can be isolated?
- What strategies can I employ to ensure that the separation of calculation logic doesnâ€™t introduce new errors or complexities?
- How does this separation align with the broader architecture and design principles of my application?
